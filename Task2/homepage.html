	<h3>
	Welcome to LC Photography! This business is owned and run by Lauren, 
	a 20 year old with a passion for horses and photography. 
	That passion has created this business and keeps it going, 
	with many hours each week taken up by both of these things. 
	Although equine photography is the primary focus, 
	LC Photography’s range begins at equine and includes family, portrait, 
	wildlife and landscape photography with room for any other requirements you may have.
